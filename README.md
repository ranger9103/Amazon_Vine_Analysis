## Overview of the Analysis
Evaluate the reviews by paid and unpaid reviewers.

## Results
There were a total of 2,643,619 reviews with 65 of the paid reviews being 5 star and 20,612 unpaid 5 star.
This leaves an insignificant percentage of the total reviews as 5 star paid reviews and only 0.77% unpaid 5 star reviews.

## Summary
Overall for pet product reviews, there is not a positive bias for 5 star ratings for paid reviews. If anything, you could argue there is a negative correlation and the program in this area should be reconsidered. It would be valuable to compare this with other products and with 4 star ratings. Then evaluate the goals and determine the best path forward.
